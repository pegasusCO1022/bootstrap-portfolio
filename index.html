                    Hi Everyone! Thanks for stopping by my page. I know your all waiting in suspense to read
                    a little more about me, so I won't keep you waiting. I have this amazing life story that 
                    begins 28 yrs ago but there is a lot so I'll keep it to the highlights.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I was born in California where my dad worked on the LA Sheriffs department. My parents wanted
                    to escape the craziness of California so we moved to a quiet little town in Montana, Columbia Falls
                    where I call home. I loved every minute of it. When I was 19 I decided to serve a two year mission in Brazil
                    where I learned to speak Portuguese and love the Brazilian people. Shortly after returning I met my future wife
                    at BYU-Idaho. I left two months after we met for a study abroad in Chile where we kept in touch over Skype and 
                    I unofficially proposed to her. We got married 3 weeks after I got back.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We both graduated from BYU-Idaho with our Bachelor's degrees two years ago this April. We have one
                    child a boy named Gideon and we just hit our 5 year anniversary this January. We are so excited for
                    the future.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Well that was fun and educational. Don't you think? I hope that gives you a little perspective about my life
                    and feel free to get in touch with me if you have any questions.
                </p>
